# Connect 4 Game

This project uses Python libraries like Pygame and NumPy to create an interactive Connect 4 game. The objective is to provide a fun and engaging two-player game where players take turns to drop pieces into a grid, aiming to connect four pieces in a row to win.

## Description

This project uses Python to implement a robust Connect 4 game with a graphical user interface, leveraging various libraries for game development, input handling, and visual representation. Below are the key components of the project:

**Importing and Initializing Packages for Game Development**

- Utilizes Pygame for creating the game window, rendering graphics, and handling user input.
- Uses NumPy for managing the game board state.

**Retrieving and Handling Player Input**

- Collects player names through an interactive input box displayed in the game window.

**Game Mechanics and Board Visualization**

- Implements game logic for dropping pieces, checking valid moves, and determining winning conditions.
- Draws the game board and updates it after each move to reflect the current state.

**Game Over Celebration**

- Displays a celebration screen with a congratulatory message and relevant graphics when a player wins the game.

**Benefits:**

- Provides a fun and interactive way to play Connect 4 on a computer.
- Enhances understanding of game logic implementation and user interaction handling.
- Easily customizable to modify game rules or add new features.

**Skills Demonstrated:** 
Python, Pygame, Game Development, User Interface Design, Event Handling
